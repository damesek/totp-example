# One Time Password (TOTP) Demo Project
[as RFC 4226 and RFC 6238] 

This project is a simple demo application that demonstrates TOTP-based two-factor authentication in Clojure.

![Demo Registration](resources/screenshot.png "TOTP Demo Registration")


It features:

- **Reitit** for routing
- **Ring (with Jetty adapter)** as the web server
- **Hiccup** for HTML generation
- **one-time** (and its QR generation submodule) for generating and verifying TOTP tokens
- A minimal EDN file-based data store for user registration
- A modern UI using **Tailwind CSS** via CDN

## Features

- **Registration:** Users can register by entering a username. The application generates a TOTP secret key, stores it in an EDN file, and displays a QR code. You can scan this QR code with an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator) to configure TOTP.
- **Login:** Users log in by providing their username and a 6-digit TOTP code generated by their authenticator app.
- **Protected Content:** Once authenticated, users can access a protected page that displays secure content.

## Prerequisites

- [Clojure CLI tools](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started)
- Java (JDK 8 or later)

   cd totp-demo
   ```

## 2. Run the server

```bash
clj -M:run
```
